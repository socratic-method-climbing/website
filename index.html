      <h3>Methodology</h3>
      <div id="about-me">
        <img src="images/roman.jpg" />
      </div>
      <p>
        My name is Roman Rogowski. I've been climbing for over a decade, and I
        have a passion for breaking down and analyzing the attitudes, behaviors,
        and movements of climbers.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the greater joys I've experienced along my climbing journey is
        witnessing the moment a climber takes a step towards overcoming the
        "impossible."
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe such moments can be cultivated via the practice of deep
        self-inquiry. To improve as climbers—to ask more of ourselves—we must
        <i>ask more</i> of ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        As your coach, I'll help you learn how to analyze various aspects of
        your performance, how to ask yourself better questions, and how to
        discover your own unique solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through this approach, I believe we can overcome any limitations that
        are standing in your way of progress. Let's do this.

      <h3>FAQ</h3>
      <p><b>What is a payment authorization hold?</b></p>
      <p>
        A payment authorization hold is used to ensure that your payment method
        is active, which helps prevent potential payment issues on the date(s)
        of service. This hold is not a charge and will be refunded in 3-5
        business days.
      </p>
      <p><b>When will my payment method be charged?</b></p>
      <p>
        Your payment method will be charged on the date of the first service.
      </p>
      <p><b>How do I cancel or reschedule a booking?</b></p>
      <p>
        To cancel or reschedule a booking, please
        <a href="mailto:admin@socraticmethodclimbing.com">email me</a>.
        Cancellation or rescheduling requests must be made at least 48 hours in
        advance. Failure to do so will result in a charge equal to a fixed fee
        of $175.
      </p>
      <p><b>I have a different question.</b></p>
      <p>
