        "Your methods of coaching are something that I had never 
        experienced before but I quickly grew to love your style. You 
        always asked questions first and gave me a chance to figure out 
        the solutions to problems on my own. When necessary you would 
        step in and give solid advice that was well catered to me."

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        My name is Roman Rogowski. I've been climbing for over ten years, and I have a 
        passion for analyzing the movements, behaviors, and mindsets of climbers.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe that climbers can improve not only through strength 
        training, but also via the practice of deep 
        self-inquiry—<i>asking more</i> to achieve more.
      </p>
      <p>
        As your coach, I'll teach you to analyze your performance, ask better 
        questions, and find your own path to progress. Let's find out what you're 
        really capable of.
